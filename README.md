# CFA-tutr

An app that brings together 2 students so one can teach and the other can learn or vice-versa. The same student can be both tutor or tutoree.

## About the Project

A group project given to the class to practice working as a team in an Agile teamwork environment. We were given 2 days to come up with a solution to one of three educational challenges. We choose: Hard to accommodate both students who are struggling and excelling in a classroom.

Following the ideation process we moved through many ideas until we came up with an idea that inspired us. We choose a gamified student matching program as we thought it would be an incentive for students to both become tutors and to be tutored.
